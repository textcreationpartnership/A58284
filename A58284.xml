            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Estates being met, <hi>Godwin</hi> who was sent for, refused to attend, pretending Service against the <hi>Welsh,</hi> so that now suspitions on both sides encreasing, great preparations were made on both sides.

Which being by the King refused (as it was but reason) the haughty Earl prepared to give his <hi>Soveraign</hi> Battle: But the more prudent, guided by their foresight of the Imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, threatning the Kings Person, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Consequences on both sides, probably to be expected, laboured so industriously, that the whole matter was at last referred to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43770:6"/> to be held at <hi>London,</hi> with all convenient speed.</p>
               <p>In order to this Agreement, King <hi>Edward</hi> strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded with an Army of <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbrians,</hi> enters <hi>London,</hi> while <hi>Godwin</hi> and his <hi>Son,</hi> with an attendance no less formidable, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himself at his own House in <hi>Southwark.</hi> But then his Army wavering, and as bad causes and consciences make men do, suspecting the worst, by little and little shrunk away from him, which being known to the King, he presently pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Sentence</hi> of Banishment against the Rebel <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> and his five <hi>Sons,</hi> without farther proceeding by way of Parliament, as he had determined. Thereupon <hi>Godwin</hi> with a vast Mass of Wealth, and three of his <hi>Sons</hi> failed into <hi>Fland rs,</hi> while the other two passed into <hi>Ireland;</hi> who being thus dispersed, were by the King proclaimed Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws.</p>
               <p>In the second year of his Banishment, <hi>Godwin</hi> and his three <hi>Sons,</hi> having furnished himself with several <hi>Ships</hi> of War, came upon the Coasts of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> where they landed and returned laden with <hi>Spoiles.</hi> The like did <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>Leof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> his two other <hi>Sons,</hi> upon the Coasts of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> whence coasting about the point of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> they joyn'd their Fathers Fleet near the Isle of <hi>Wight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King not enduring the Insolence of these Outlaw'd Rebels, with a Navy of sixty <hi>Ships</hi> well fitted for War, intended to have made an end of those Rebellious Devestations, by the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43770:6"/> of the Disloyal <hi>Godwin</hi> and his <hi>Sons:</hi> But the Fleets being ready to engage, such a thick Fog overspread the <hi>Sea,</hi> that the Fleets could not see one another; at what time <hi>Godwin</hi> and his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices were driven by contrary Winds, to the place from whence they came. However King <hi>Edward</hi> still jealous of his Return, set forth a Navy of forty stout <hi>Ships</hi> to secure the <hi>Seas,</hi> who did not keep so strict a watch, but that <hi>Godwin</hi> slipped by them, and having gained the People of <hi>Kent, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> and <hi>Surrey</hi> to his Assistance, entered the <hi>Thames,</hi> where he did the like to those of <hi>London,</hi> who accepted of his Arrival, though King <hi>Edward</hi> lay there, so that without disturbance, his Navy warp'd up with a Tide through the South-Arch of the Bridg, while a mighty Army mustered to his aid upon the same side of the River.</p>
               <p>Thus the Nobility finding English against En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, ready to embrue their hands in each others Blood, wrought so far with the King and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subject, that conditions of Peace were agreed on, and pledges delivered for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godwin</hi> now restored to the Kings favour, might seem to have prospered by his Rebellion, and to have gained by the Breach of his Allegiance, to his Lawful Soveraign; but if he were too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the King to punish for his misdeeds, yet he could not escape the Vengeance and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of <hi>Heaven,</hi> which prosecuted him so far, that he was suddainly surprized with the stroke of Death, as he sat at Table with that Soveraign
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43770:7"/> Prince of his, to whom he had given so much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and rebellious Trouble, contrary to his sworn Fealtie and Homage.</p>

               <p>Therefore was he punish'd by the hand of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> as we have heard, in his own person; and afterwards in the Persons of two Sons, <hi>Swain</hi> and <hi>Harold.</hi> The first of which was murdered by the <hi>Saracens:</hi> His other Son <hi>Harold,</hi> who had taken part with his Father in his Rebellious Practises, as one whom <hi>Heaven</hi> had decreed to depress, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither the good Councel of his <hi>Fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> they were so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as to overthrow the Kings Lieutenant whom he sent against them, but when the King himself drew near them in Person, the very terrour of his <hi>Approach</hi> daunted all their farther <hi>Attempts,</hi> so that he easily took several of the Chief Authors of the Rebellion, of which he punished some by cutting off their <hi>Hands,</hi> and others by taking off their <hi>Heads,</hi> according to the merits of their Crime.</p>

Nor is there any doubt to be made, but that the <hi>King</hi> had been an easie Victor over <hi>Romes</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, had not the Nobility been envenom'd with the Clergy's infection.

               <p>Nor was this all, for then the Church-men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to act their parts again, and <hi>Stephen Langhton</hi> with the Bishops of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> thirsting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter revenge, though with the ruine of their <hi>Prince</hi> and Country, with loud complements sollicited their Lord the Pope, to support the <hi>English Church</hi> at the point of Ruin.

On the otherside <hi>King John</hi> was no less vigilant for his own defence: Nor was he yet so ill beloved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, but that upon his Summons, such infinite Numbers flockt to <hi>Dover</hi> and the Sea Coasts there abouts, that the Officers were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to dismiss many <hi>Thousands,</hi> retaining only the

               <p>But if these had any pretence or colour while deposed <hi>Richard</hi> was yet alive, yet the <hi>Fiery Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spur,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Son, and the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> his Fathers Brother after <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>'s Decease, could alledge no excuse for those fatal <hi>Animosities</hi> which Armed them against their Sovereign, to both their Confusions.</p>
               <p>However, the colourable causes of their taking Armes, were the usual <hi>Paintings</hi> and <hi>Flourishes</hi> that set off such Attempts, the great care of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths Reformation,</hi> and their own safety. But the <hi>Kernel</hi> of their Design was, to thrust <hi>Henry</hi> out of his Seat, and deprive him of his Life, and then to advance the Title of <hi>Mortimer, Earl of March,</hi> their nearest Kins-man. To this purpose, <hi>Pierce, Mortimer,</hi> and <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               <p>Nevertheless Peace was offer'd and had ensu'd, but that the mischievous Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> by misreporting and falsifying his Sovereigns words, precipated his <hi>Nephew</hi> into suddain Battle.</p>
               <p>The Kings Courage was not small in the Fight, as neither was the Danger: The Young Prince of <hi>VVales</hi> being Wounded with an Arrow in the Face, the Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> and Earl <hi>Douglass,</hi> then whom it is said, That the wide World had not two greater Champions, instead of spending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the Multitude, bent all their fierceness upon the King, in whose Person they were sure ten thousand fell. With this Resolution they most furiously rush'd forward with their Spears and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43770:25"/> Swords, but the Earl of <hi>Dunbar</hi> discovering their purpose, drew the King from the place which he had design'd to make good, and thereby in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood sav'd his Life; for the <hi>Standard</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, the <hi>Standard</hi> Bearer slain, and ten other Knights Fighting to defend the <hi>Standard,</hi> all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Wounded: besides that, <hi>Douglass</hi> with his own hand slew three that day that were severally in the <hi>Kings Coat-Armour,</hi> so that many thought that the King had been kill'd, and ran out of the Field.</p>
               <p>Thus lasted a most obstinate and bloody Contest between a Sovereign and his Rebellious Subjects for above three hours, till at length <hi>Hotspur</hi> still Riding in the Head of the Battle in contempt of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> met with his match, and was slain by an unknown hand, with whose fall the Courages of all the rest fell into their Feet, of which they made the speediest use they could to save themselves.</p>
               <p>Rebellion and Disloyalty thus vanquished in the Field, and Treason having by Providence lost her chief support, the Earl of <hi>VVorcester,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Vernan,</hi> and the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Kinderton,</hi> three of the most eminent Rebels, had their Heads chopt off the next day but one after the Battle; And as for the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> though his Life was pardoned, yet his Revenues were Confiscated, and himself reduced to a Pension of Necessary Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which (however) the King, when he had sufficiently humbled him, out of a particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and compassion toward him, restored him
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43770:26"/> afterwards in Parliament, all which nevertheless did not save his <hi>Head</hi> at the long run.</p>
               <p>No sooner was this <hi>Rebellion</hi> thus appeased, but <hi>Tho. Mowbray, E. Marshal,</hi> disliking it seems the Carriage of publick matters, draws <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Which done, the King pursued the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> who notwithstanding all his late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours was relapsed again into his former Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and the Lord <hi>Bardolph,</hi> and forced them both to take Sanctuarie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the loss of his Castles and Mannors, which the King seized a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time into his own <hi>Hands.</hi> The said Earl and Lord, not long after endeavouring to raise new stirs in the North of <hi>England,</hi> were encountered by the Sheriff of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> at what time the Earl was slain out right, and the Lord <hi>Bardolph</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded.

The next day the King presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Battle upon the Plain; Nor did the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Earl refuse him, but coming down, joyned Battle with him: The fight was fierce and obstinate for three hours; but at length the Victory fell to the <hi>King,</hi> to whom of right it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. The Chieftains of the Rebels, the Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lovel,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Broughton</hi> and <hi>Swart</hi> were all slain: The Young Counterfeit <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> now <hi>Lambert Simnel</hi> again with his Crafty Tutor were all taken Prisoners, so that the King was now absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the whole Rebellion. As for <hi>Lambert Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> he was preferred from wearing a Counterfeit Crown to be a turn-broach in the Kings Kitching: and his Tutor being committed a close Prisoner, was never heard of more.

               <p>These Reports took hold of divers, in some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Discontent, in some upon Ambition, in some upon Levity and Desire of Change.

               <p>Thereupon they sent to the King for the redress of their Greivances; in Answer to which the King required their Obedience and Submission to his Royal Authority, as others had done; to whom for so doing he had already not only shewed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but granted redress of their just grievances, otherwise that they were to expect the utmost se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity that Traytors deserved.</p>

               <p>Others there were, and those in a very great number, who had either wasted their Fortunes, or thought them too mean for the great parts of which they believed themselves to be Masters, while others that had able Bodies, saw no better way to get their Bread, then by Fishing in troubl'd Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. All these long'd for War, hoping to live more splendidly by the lucky choice of a Party to side with, and therefore generally serv'd them who had most plenty of Money.</p>
               <p>But lastly, the people were in general so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their Duties, that not one perhaps of a thousand, knew what right any Man had to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, or what necessity there was of a King, for whom he was to part with his Money against his will; So that the People being thus Principl'd of themselves, were easily made the Kings Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by the Indefatigable Preaching of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Ministers,</hi> and the <hi>Seditious Whisperings</hi> of False and Ignorant Politicians.</p>
               <p>At this Unfortunate Time a Parliament was call'd, to sit at <hi>Westminster</hi> the 3d. of <hi>Novemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Mutinous Democraticks</hi> being got together, first they call'd in Question such as had either Preach'd or Written in Defence of those
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43770:47"/> Rites that belong'd to the Crown; And for those that had been Imprison'd for Writing and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons and Books tending to <hi>Sedition,</hi> by their own <hi>Authority</hi> they order'd their setting at Liberty. In the next place they accus'd the King of a Purpose to Introduce and Authorize the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion,</hi> than which nothing was more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the People; and to deprive the King of such Ministers, as by their Courage, Wisdom, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they thought most able to prevent or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Designs against the King; They first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> of <hi>High-Treason,</hi> who was soon after Beheaded. Afterwards they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and got him lay'd up fast in the <hi>Tower:</hi> And to make sure of their sitting, they obtain'd of the King to pass an Act, That the present Parliament should continue, till both Houses should consent to the Dissolution of it.</p>
               <p>Their next Dispute was, concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> which, because the King would not part withal, as being the undoubted Right of his <hi>Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> they told him plainly, That they should be forc'd, unless he would consent to their desires, to dispose of the <hi>Militia</hi> by the Authority of both Houses, for the safety of His Majesty, and the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>To which purpose they resolved in case of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream danger, and of His Majesties refusal, the Ordinance agreed upon by both Houses for the <hi>Militia,</hi> did oblige the People by the Fundamental Laws of the People; to back which, they added
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43770:47"/> farther, that when the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which is the <hi>Supreme Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature</hi> in the Kingdom, shall declare what the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> is, to have that not only questioned but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, was a high breach of the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was not only to take the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> but the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> also from the King, who as he only made the <hi>Laws,</hi> had only <hi>Power</hi> to declare what the <hi>Law</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Much about this time the <hi>King</hi> being retir'd to <hi>York</hi> from the affronts and clamours of the Insolent and Audacious City Tumults, the <hi>Democraticks</hi> sent down Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> to secure that Town and <hi>Magazine</hi> for their use; so that when the King came to demand with only some of his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Servants and some few of the Gentlemen of the County, he was denyed, entrance by the said Sir <hi>John</hi> then standing upon the Wall: For which, when the King required Justice to be done him, and that the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Magazine</hi> might be delivered into his Hands, the <hi>Democraticks</hi> return'd no answer, but in a Declaration full of slanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majesties Government published.</p>
               <p>That whatsoever they declared to be Law, was not to be questioned.</p>
               <p>That no Precedents could be limits to bound their Proceedings.</p>
               <p>That the Parliament for the publick good might dispose of any thing wherein the King or People had right.</p>
               <p>That the Soveraign Power resided in the Houses, and that the King was to have no Negative Voice.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43770:48"/>
               <p>That the Levying of Forces against the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commands of the King is not Levying War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, but Levying War against his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Person, his <hi>Laws,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Treason</hi> could not be committed against the King otherwise then as he is entrusted with the Kingdom and discharges his <hi>Trust,</hi> and that they had a Power to judge whether he had discharged his trust or no.</p>
               <p>And lastly, that they might dispose of the <hi>King</hi> as they would; having gone thus far, as it were a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald of defyance to pronounce open Hostility, they sent the King nineteen Propositions, with a choice of War or Peace upon refusal or condescention, the Chief of which were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Lords</hi> and others of the <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,</hi> and all great Officers of State, both at home and abroad, be put from their Employments, and from his Council, save only such as should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by both Houses of Parliament, and none put into their places but by approbation of the said <hi>House,</hi> and that the Privy Councellors should take two Oaths for the Execution of their places, as should be agreed on by both <hi>Houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the great Affairs of the Kingdom should be resolved and transacted only in Parliament, and such as should presume to do any thing contrary to be reserved to the Censure of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Lord High Steward, High Constable, Lord Chancellour, Lord Treasurer, Privy Seal, Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal, Lord Admiral, Warden</hi> of the <hi>Cinque Ports, Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Chequer; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries</hi>

               <p>That the Peers by Bill should be restrained from Acting and Voting in the <hi>House,</hi> unless admitted with the consent of both <hi>Houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the King should raise no Guards but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, in case of actual <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the sending of these Propositions, which was no more then <hi>Actual Rebellion</hi> in it self, and that his Majestie had refused to grant them, they began on both sides to prepare for War.</p>
               <p>The King raised a Guard for his Person in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and the Parliament thereupon having Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the King intended thereupon to make War upon the Parliament, gave order for Muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Forces, and raising Money, of which they made the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> General.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rebellion</hi> thus begun, many Battles and Skirmishes were fought with various success, tho for a while with much more advantage to the <hi>King</hi> than the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who finding that the King made good his ground so well in the <hi>South,</hi> and that his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> prospered so victoriously in the <hi>North,</hi> were forced to call in the <hi>Scots</hi> for their assistants, for whose satisfaction they Sacrificed <hi>Arch-bishop Laud,</hi> and entered into that solemn <hi>Leag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In two Battles the Parliament were eminently victorious in that of <hi>Marston Moor,</hi> and that other called the second <hi>Nembury</hi> Fight; by which the Parliament believing that <hi>Essex</hi> did not Prosecute as he ought to have done, the advantages he had got, the Parliament began to have an ill opinion of him, and from hence the new modelling of the <hi>Army</hi> was projected; to which purpose, as every Change begins with Outcries, the noise of Justice was now against Delinquents. And here we must begin to observe the first Fruits of Gods revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Maintainers and Abettors of this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which <hi>Heaven</hi> did afterwards so fully Prosecute to the ignominious fall and destruction of so many detestible <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Regicides.</hi> For who were these Delinquents, but such as have been their Creatures, and done them that Service which enabled them to play the pranks they p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The first was Sir <hi>Alexander Carew,</hi> and the two <hi>Hothams</hi> both Father and Son, who for their Disloyalty to their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> were put to death for being false to <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traitors.</hi> This was the same Person, who being desired by <hi>Sir Bevil Greenvile,</hi> not to give his Vote against the Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> of the <hi>Lord Strafford,</hi> made answer, that if he were sure he should be the next Man that should suffer upon the same <hi>Scaffold,</hi> with the same <hi>Ax,</hi> he would give his consent to the passing it.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43770:49"/>
               <p>Some few days after, both the <hi>Hothams</hi> were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at the same place, for endeavouring to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray <hi>Hull</hi> to the King, and holding Correspondence with the Marquiss of <hi>New-Castle,</hi> of whom it will be enough to observe what his late Majesty himself observed upon their last ends.</p>
               <p>Nor did a single Vengeance serve the turn; the cutting of one Head in a Family is not enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate for the affront done to the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal.</hi> The Eldest Son must be involved in the Punishment, as he was infected with the Sin of his Father, against the Father of his Country, Root and Branch God cut off in one day.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That which makes me more pity him vvas, that after he began to have some Inclinations of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his Sin, and reparation of his Duty to me, he should be so <hi>unhappy</hi> as to fall into the <hi>Hands</hi> of <hi>their Justice</hi> and not <hi>my Mercy,</hi> vvho could as vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have forgiven <hi>H m</hi> as <hi>He</hi> could have asked that favour of <hi>Me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Poor Gentleman, he is now become a notable Monument of unprosperous Loyalty; teaching the world by so sad an unfortunate Spectacle, that the rude carriage of a Subject carries always its own Vengeance as an unseparable shadow with it, and those oft prove the most Fatal and Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Executioners of it, who were the first Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers in the <hi>Service.</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43770:50"/> from them, resigned them of their own accord. And this was the reward which <hi>Essex</hi> received for all the good <hi>Services</hi> which he performed for a Nest of Rebels against their Prince; who having now lost the opportunity of blessing the Kingdom with a Peace, when it lay in his Power; and to which he was Courted but a while before by the King at <hi>Lestithiel,</hi> withdrew himself in discontent to his House at <hi>Eltham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where not long after he died, not without suspicion of being poysoned by them, for whom he had so far blasted his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heading their unnatural Rebellion. They who were before such great adorers of his Person, now scorned and contemned him like Adulterous kindness, which changed into Hatred and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the admiration of those whom his Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity had estranged from their first love to their Prince, who ceased not to prosecute his Honour with publick Dicteries and ridiculous Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Print.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>his Death</hi> it plainly appeared that the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Presbytery</hi> was departed, which had actuated that self-designing, formless <hi>Schism</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to a mad and infatuated Division in the <hi>State,</hi> and armed its <hi>Hands</hi> with Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to propagate its Dominion and Magisterial Usurpation.

               <p>Having thus levell'd all things before them, they procur'd an Abolition of all Orders, Votes, and Ordinances, that had pass'd in the absence of the two <hi>Speakers.</hi> And yet this Ordinance of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation would not pass among the more stubborn of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> till the <hi>Speaker</hi> pull'd out a Letter from <hi>Cromwell,</hi> taxing them with what was truly cast in their <hi>Teeth</hi> in reference to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, though not so deservedly for what they then had done, with <hi>Treason, Treachery,</hi> and <hi>Breach of Trust,</hi> declaring further, That if they should presume to come there before they had clear'd themselves from assenting to such and such Votes, they should sit at their peril, and that he would take them as Prisoners of War, and try them by a Council of War.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43770:52"/> Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> the Lords <hi>Berkley, Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parkham, Hunsdon,</hi> and <hi>Maynard,</hi> were Committed to the <hi>Black Rod:</hi> several of the <hi>House of Commons</hi> were likewise suspended, and others committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> together with the <hi>Lord Major,</hi> and several of the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> while <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Massey</hi> were forc'd to flye into <hi>Holland.</hi> And thus by a just <hi>Retaliation</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> they who had made their Prince a Captive were now become most miserable slaves to their own <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the subsequent Prevarications and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Overtures made by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the King, and their close restraint of him to supple him to Condescention, we pass them over, as hastening to the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who were the first Authors of the <hi>Rebellion.</hi> This is only to be said, <hi>That those Shufflings and Cuttings with His Majesty had so enraged the Discontents of the People, that the Nation was in several parts almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in a second War: what with the</hi> Kentish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, <hi>the</hi> Revolt <hi>in Wales, and the</hi> Scotish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion; <hi>so that the Parliament seeing so many Dangers appear at one and the same time with doubtful Faces, and fearing the Dubiousness of success, began to think of making some Provision for their own safety, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more especially the</hi> Scotch Storm; <hi>to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, they recall'd,</hi> Their Votes of Non Addresses, <hi>and voted the Kings Condescentions a sufficient Ground to proceed to a personal Treaty, with Honour, Freedom, and Safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Fairfax</hi> having Dissipated the Southern
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43770:53"/> Storms, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> having clear'd <hi>Wales,</hi> and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated the <hi>Scots,</hi> and both returning home Arm'd with fresh Lawrels, and now more Insolent with success, call'd their presumptious slaves to a severe account, which now must pay off all their old Scores with <hi>Ignominy</hi> and <hi>Dismission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For now these <hi>Catiffs</hi> understanding the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the House, resolv'd to play no longer with the weak Read of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> but with a bold Sword dissolve the <hi>Oracle</hi> of their Villanies; To this purpose, <hi>Pride, Huson,</hi> and some other Officers, having had some Conferences together in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Hall</hi> with the <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Dore being shut, sent in a Paper to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> requiring the Impeach'd Members, and Major General <hi>Brown,</hi> as Guilty of calling in <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to be secur'd and brought to Justice, and that the 90 odd Members, who refus'd to Vote against the late <hi>Scotch Engagement,</hi> might be immediately suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the House, and that all such faithful <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus were the mighty Grandees of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cast down from their Seats, where they had so long usurped their Soveraign's Dominion, and laid the Foundation of his utter Ruin. Nor did this <hi>Jeroboam</hi> of a <hi>Cromwel,</hi> rending the Tyranny out of their <hi>Rebellious Hands,</hi> leave them so much as one Tribe to Domineer over: But first pull'd 'em out as it were by the Ears, then Imprisoned 'em, and afterwards with shame and Ignominy dismissed 'em, Cashier'd, Discarded, Contemned and Scorn'd by those whom they themselves had mounted into the Saddle of their own Illegal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, And this was the Just reward of the first F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>llies and Treasons of the Independants.</p>
               <p>And now was the whole Body of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reduced to an Inconsiderable <hi>Juncto,</hi> wholly at the Devotion of their Great <hi>Sultan Cromwel,</hi> who nevertheless served them outwardly with great Diligence, till by their assistance he had most
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43770:54"/>
                  <hi>Inhumanly</hi> &amp; <hi>Irreligiously</hi> taken away the <hi>Kings Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that being done, and himself now swelled to that excessive bulk of loftiness, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the narrow limits of a General-ship, as he that had so lately reduced <hi>Ireland,</hi> conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Scotland,</hi> overthrown the King at <hi>Worcester,</hi> thought it now time to reap the benefit of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Labours. And therefore looking upon the <hi>Juncto</hi> of his pretended Masters, only as an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and feeble Crew, that stood upon his Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet threatned to beat him with them, and to <hi>Essex</hi> him out of all his Grandeur, he resolved to cut the Gordian knot of all their Intreagues.</p>
               <p>To this purpose attended with <hi>Lambert, Harison</hi> and some other of his great Officers, he entered the House, and after a short speech, wherein he shewed the Reasons and necessities of their Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he declared the <hi>Juncto</hi> to be dissolved, and desired the Members to depart.</p>
               <p>Upon which <hi>Harison</hi> peremptorily bid the <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> leave the Chair, which he refusing to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order of the House; or till he was pulled out, <hi>Harrison</hi> desired him to lend him his Hand, and gently heav'd him out. <hi>Cromwel</hi> also commanded their Bauble as he called it the Mace, to be taken away, and so having turned the Wretches out of Doors, lock't 'em up, and clapt Guards upon 'em, and about all the Avenues into the Palace, to prevent those Spirits from possessing it again.</p>
               <p>The News of the fall of these <hi>Lucifers</hi> was quickly spread through the City, and from thence over the Country, where it was related and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43770:54"/> with all imaginable gladness, while the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers slunk away muttering to themselves the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front they had received, and laying their Heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether how to retrieve themselves; for loath they were to acknowledg their <hi>Dissolution,</hi> but whatever they fancied to the contrary, raving at this Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Audaciousness of their Servant as they called him, <hi>Cromwel</hi> their Master, minded it not, but went on with his Business.</p>
               <p>Certainly Fate never plaid such a frolick part, nor was there ever such a Scene of Mirth in all her Mazes and Varieties of Government, so unusual it is for the greatest and most potent of wicked men, to survive the Infamy and Dishonour of their Actions, unless it be to live the Ignominy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of themselves. But as if God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the threatned punishment of the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, these unparallel'd Parricides were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to out live the Desire of Life, and to see all their Greatness buried, their Reputation abroad, and their Dread at Home fallen into such Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Disgrace, that it was the common Theme of Ballads, the most scurrilous and contemptible that was to be imagined. On the other side <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was more applauded by the People for this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then any of his Victories in the War, while none were more derided and scorned than those Reformado's of Petty Princes.</p>
               <p>Thus the two first <hi>Scenes</hi> of this <hi>Tragical Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being past; the next was the <hi>Scene</hi> of <hi>Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which concluding with the <hi>Tyrants Life;</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> were but the struglings and uttermost efforts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43770:55"/> of Anarchy and Confusion, drawing to a Mortal Dissolution, which ended at length in the happy and long panted-after Restauration of his present <hi>Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then it was, that Divine Vengeance having trac'd the <hi>Murderers</hi> of their <hi>Martyr'd Soveraign,</hi> at last through several <hi>Mazes</hi> overtook them, the Iron Hand of Justice delivering them up to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due to their unparallel'd Impiety. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it were thought fit, as well to shew his <hi>Majesties</hi> Clemency to the lesser guilty of his undutiful People, that an Act of Oblivion should pass for the general safety of the Nation, yet that his Justice might appear as equally Resplendent in not suffering such an <hi>unexampl'd Parricide</hi> to go vvith <hi>unexampled Impunity,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> thought it altogether as necessary to Exclude from <hi>Mercy,</hi> the <hi>Chief Authors</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> in the <hi>Late Rebellion</hi> and more <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thereupon a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> was issu'd out for the Tryal of the several Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders according to their merits; for no less then two days of Judgment will suffice for <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Disloyalty.</hi>
